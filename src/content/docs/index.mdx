## How the Toolkit Fits Together

The **API Server** is the central brain. Both the **Mobile Client** and the **Web Dashboard** communicate with it to fetch data, authenticate users, and retrieve configuration. The **Web Dashboard** is used to populate the content that the **Mobile Client** displays.

This separation of concerns makes the toolkit robust and flexible. You can manage your entire platform from the web and deliver updates to your mobile users instantly.

## Get Started: Try, Evaluate, and Launch

This toolkit is source-available, allowing you to explore the code and ensure it meets your standards before making a commitment.
