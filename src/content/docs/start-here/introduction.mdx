## Welcome to the Toolkit

Welcome to the Flutter News App Full Source Code Toolkit, a production-ready, three-part ecosystem designed for seamless integration. It provides everything you need to launch, manage, and scale a modern news application.

Each component is built on a foundation of clean architecture, ensuring the system is maintainable, scalable, and a pleasure to work with.

## The Ecosystem

The toolkit is composed of three core pillars. Understanding the role of each is the first step to mastering the system.

	<Card title="Mobile Client App" icon="phone">
		A feature-rich Flutter application for iOS and Android that delivers a
		beautiful, intuitive news reading experience to your users. It is the primary
		end-user-facing component.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Web Dashboard" icon="laptop">
		A comprehensive Flutter web app for administrators and publishers to manage
		content, configure app settings, and view key analytics. This is your
		control center.
	</Card>
  <Card title="API Server" icon="cloud">
		A high-performance backend built with Dart Frog, providing robust APIs for
		authentication, data management, and remote configuration that serve both the
		mobile and web clients.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## How It Fits Together

The **API Server** is the central brain. Both the **Mobile Client** and the **Web Dashboard** communicate with it to fetch data, authenticate users, and retrieve configuration. The **Web Dashboard** is used to populate the content that the **Mobile Client** displays.

This separation of concerns makes the system robust and flexible. You can manage your entire platform from the web and deliver updates to your mobile users instantly.
