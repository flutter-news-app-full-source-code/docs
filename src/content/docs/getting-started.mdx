Welcome to the local setup guide for the Flutter News App Toolkit. To get the full ecosystem running on your local machine, you will need to set up each of the three core components: the **API Server**, the **Web Dashboard**, and the **Mobile Client**.

Follow the guides below in the recommended order to ensure a smooth setup process.
