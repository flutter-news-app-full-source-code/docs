Welcome to the local setup guide for the Flutter News App Toolkit. To get the full ecosystem running on your local machine, you will need to set up each of the three core components: the **API Server**, the **Web Dashboard**, and the **Mobile Client**.

Follow the guides below in the recommended order to ensure a smooth setup process.

	<Step title="Set Up the API Server">
		Start by getting the backend running. The API server handles data,
		authentication, and configuration for both the dashboard and the mobile app.
