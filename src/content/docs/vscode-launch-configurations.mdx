title: Configuring VS Code Launch Environments
description: A guide to setting up VS Code launch configurations for different app environments.

To streamline the development process, you can configure Visual Studio Code to easily run your Flutter application in different environments (`demo`, `development`, or `production`) directly from the "Run and Debug" panel. This avoids the need to manually type the `flutter run` command with the correct `--dart-define` arguments each time.

<Aside type="caution" title="Important Security Note">
  The `launch.json` file can contain sensitive information, such as production API URLs or other secrets. To prevent accidentally exposing these values, it is strongly recommended to add `.vscode/launch.json` to your project's `.gitignore` file.

  This ensures it remains a local-only configuration and is not committed to your version control system.

### Create a `launch.json` File

1.  In your project's root directory, create a folder named `.vscode` if it doesn't already exist.
2.  Inside the `.vscode` folder, create a new file named `launch.json`.
3.  Copy and paste the following JSON configuration into your `launch.json` file.

```json title=".vscode/launch.json"
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Demo - Flutter News App",
            "request": "launch",
            "type": "dart",
            "program": "lib/main.dart",
            "args": [
                "--dart-define=APP_ENVIRONMENT=demo"
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "Development - Flutter News App",
            "request": "launch",
            "type": "dart",
            "program": "lib/main.dart",
            "args": [
                "--dart-define=APP_ENVIRONMENT=development",
                "--dart-define=BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080"
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "Production - Flutter News App",
            "request": "launch",
            "type": "dart",
            "program": "lib/main.dart",
            "args": [
                "--dart-define=APP_ENVIRONMENT=production",
                "--dart-define=BASE_URL=https://api.your-production-domain.com"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### How to Use

After saving the file, open the "Run and Debug" panel in VS Code (you can use the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+D`). You will now see a dropdown menu at the top with the launch configurations: "Demo - Flutter News App", "Development - Flutter News App", and "Production - Flutter News App".

Simply select the environment you want to run and press the green play button (or `F5`) to launch the application with the correct settings.
