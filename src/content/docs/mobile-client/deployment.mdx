This guide outlines the process for deploying the Flutter News App Mobile Client to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

<Aside>
To ensure you have the most reliable and up-to-date instructions, this guide focuses on the project-specific configuration you need to complete. For the deployment itself, we will refer you to the official Flutter documentation, which is the definitive resource for releasing mobile applications.

### Pre-Deployment Configuration

Before you can build the app for production, you must configure it to connect to your live API server.

<Steps>
1.  **Set the Production Environment**

    -   Open the file `lib/main.dart`.
    -   Locate the `appEnvironment` constant.
    -   Set its value to `AppEnvironment.production`.

    ```dart title="lib/main.dart"
    // Use `AppEnvironment.production` to connect to a live backend API.
    const appEnvironment = AppEnvironment.production; 
    ```

2.  **Verify the API Base URL**

    -   Open the file `lib/app/config/app_config.dart`.
    -   Ensure that the `baseUrl` for the `production` case points to the correct URL of your deployed [API Server](/docs/api-server/deployment/).

</Steps>

### Building and Releasing

Once your configuration is ready, you can proceed with building and releasing the application. The official Flutter documentation provides comprehensive, platform-specific guides that cover every required step, from generating app icons to configuring code signing and uploading to the stores.

Following these official guides is the recommended and most reliable path to a successful release.
