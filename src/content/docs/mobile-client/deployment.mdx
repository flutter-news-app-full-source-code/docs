This guide outlines the process for deploying the Flutter News App Mobile Client to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

<Aside>
To ensure you have the most reliable and up-to-date instructions, this guide focuses on the project-specific configuration you need to complete. For the platform-specific signing and release process, we will refer you to the official Flutter documentation, which is the definitive resource.

### Pre-Deployment Configuration

<Steps>
1.  **Configure Production Environment Variables**

    The application is designed to be configured at compile time using `--dart-define` variables. This is the same method used for local setup, but with your production values. This approach ensures that no secret keys are ever hardcoded in the source code.

    When you run `flutter build`, you must provide all the required variables for a production environment.

    For a complete list of all required variables and where to find them, please refer to the **Configure the Environment** section in the local setup guide.

    <Aside type="caution">
    Forgetting to provide these variables or providing placeholder values will cause the build to fail, which is a safety feature to prevent misconfigured releases.
    </Aside>

2.  **Configure App Icons**

    The project uses `flutter_launcher_icons` to generate app icons. You will need to update the configuration in `pubspec.yaml` to use your own icon assets.

    -   Open `pubspec.yaml`.
    -   Locate the `flutter_launcher_icons` section.
    -   Update the `image_path` to point to your desired icon image.
    -   After updating, run the following command to generate the new icons:
        ```bash
        flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
        ```
    <Aside type="tip">
    For more details, refer to the flutter_launcher_icons documentation.
    </Aside>

3.  **Configure Native Splash Screen**

    The project uses `flutter_native_splash` for native splash screens. You will need to update the configuration in `pubspec.yaml` to use your own splash screen assets and colors.

    -   Open `pubspec.yaml`.
    -   Locate the `flutter_native_splash` section.
    -   Update `color`, `color_dark`, `image`, and `image_dark` to match your branding.
    -   After updating, run the following command to generate the new splash screens:
        ```bash
        flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create
        ```
    <Aside type="tip">
        For more details, refer to the [flutter_native_splash documentation](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_native_splash).    
    </Aside>
</Steps>

### Building and Releasing

Once your configuration is ready, you can proceed with building and releasing the application. The official Flutter documentation provides comprehensive, platform-specific guides that cover every required step, from code signing to uploading to the stores.

Following these official guides is the recommended and most reliable path to a successful release.
