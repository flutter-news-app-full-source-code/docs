This guide provides a high-level overview of the tasks required to build and deploy the Flutter News App Mobile Client to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

For detailed, step-by-step instructions, this guide will link to the official Flutter and platform documentation. These are the definitive resources and are always kept up-to-date.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need active developer accounts for the platforms you are targeting:
-   **Google Play Console:** [developer.android.com/distribute](https://developer.android.com/distribute)
-   **Apple Developer Program:** [developer.apple.com/programs](https://developer.apple.com/programs/)

<Steps>
1.  **Configure for Production**

    First, ensure the app is configured to connect to your live production API.

    -   Open the file `lib/main.dart`.
    -   Locate the `appEnvironment` constant.
    -   Set its value to `AppEnvironment.production`.

    ```dart title="lib/main.dart"
    // Use `AppEnvironment.production` to connect to a live backend API.
    const appEnvironment = AppEnvironment.production; 
    ```

    <Aside>
    Ensure that the `baseUrl` for the `production` environment in `lib/app/config/app_config.dart` points to the correct URL of your deployed [API Server](/docs/api-server/deployment/).
