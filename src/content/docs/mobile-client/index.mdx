## Core Technologies

- **State Management**: [Bloc](https://bloclibrary.dev/) for predictable and testable state management, separating business logic from the UI.
- **Routing**: [go_router](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router) for a declarative, URL-based navigation system that is robust and easy to manage.
- **Architecture**: Follows the layered architecture principles outlined in the Core Philosophy, ensuring a clean separation of concerns between the UI, business logic, and data layers.
