description: Learn about the critical, app-wide status pages for maintenance and required updates.

import { Card, CardGrid, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The mobile client includes a set of full-screen status pages designed to handle critical, app-wide states. These pages are a key part of the [application startup flow](/docs/mobile-client/architecture/routing) and are displayed *before* the main application UI and router are ever built.

This mechanism is triggered by the `RemoteConfig` object fetched from the backend upon application startup. It allows administrators to communicate important information to all users or enforce mandatory updates.

<Aside>
The logic for displaying these pages resides in the `_AppView` widget (`lib/app/view/app.dart`), which listens to the `AppStatus` from the `AppBloc`.

<Aside type="note" title="Automatic Re-checks">
The app can also enter these states after startup. An `AppStatusService` periodically re-checks the remote configuration in the background. If it detects a change (e.g., maintenance mode has been enabled), it will immediately transition the app to the appropriate status page.

## The Status Pages

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Maintenance Page" icon="construction">
		When the `isUnderMaintenance` flag in the `RemoteConfig` is set to `true`, the application will display the `MaintenancePage`. This page informs the user that the app is temporarily unavailable and prevents them from proceeding further. It's a crucial tool for performing server-side updates without disrupting users with a broken app.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Update Required Page" icon="system-update">
		If the `isLatestVersionOnly` flag is `true` in the `RemoteConfig`, the `UpdateRequiredPage` is shown. This page instructs the user that they must update to the latest version of the app to continue. It includes a button that links directly to the appropriate app store (Apple App Store or Google Play Store), using the URL also provided in the `RemoteConfig`.
	</Card>
    <Card title="Initial Status Page" icon="cloud-download">
        This is the very first UI the user sees when a remote configuration check is required. The `StatusPage` handles two states:
        - **Loading**: Displays a loading indicator while the app is fetching the remote config (`AppStatus.configFetching`).
        - **Failure**: If the fetch fails, it shows an error message and a "Retry" button, allowing the user to attempt the connection again (`AppStatus.configFetchFailed`).
