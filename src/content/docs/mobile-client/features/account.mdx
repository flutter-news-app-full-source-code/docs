import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The Account section serves as the user's personal hub within the application. From here, they can view their profile, manage their content preferences, access saved articles, and control their sign-in status.

## Core Components

-   **`AccountBloc`**: This is the primary BLoC for managing a user's content preferences (`UserContentPreferences`). It listens for changes in the user's authentication state from the `AppBloc`. When a user signs in, it loads their preferences. It also handles all actions related to modifying these preferences, such as saving an article or following a topic.

-   **`AccountPage`**: The main UI for this feature. It displays the user's email or an "Anonymous" status, provides a sign-out or link-account button, and offers navigation to sub-pages for managing saved and followed content.

-   **`SavedHeadlinesPage`**: A dedicated page that displays a list of all the headlines the user has saved. Users can view or remove articles from this list.

## Key Functionalities

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Centralized User Preferences" icon="user-cog">
		The `AccountBloc` is responsible for fetching, creating, and updating a user's `UserContentPreferences` object. This single object holds all of the user's content-related settings, including lists of followed topics, followed sources, and saved headlines.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Saved Articles" icon="bookmark">
		Users can save any headline for later reading. This action dispatches an `AccountSaveHeadlineToggled` event to the `AccountBloc`. The `SavedHeadlinesPage` then displays a clean, scrollable list of these saved articles.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Followed Content Management" icon="list-check">
		The "Content Preferences" section allows users to manage the topics and sources they follow. This is where the `AvailableTopicsBloc` and `AvailableSourcesBloc` are used to fetch lists of all available entities that the user can choose to follow or unfollow.
	</Card>
    <Card title="Seamless Anonymous to Authenticated Flow" icon="link">
        The `AccountPage` intelligently adapts its UI based on the user's status. For anonymous users, it presents a clear call-to-action to "link" their account, providing a smooth transition to the authentication flow to save their preferences permanently.
