import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The Entity Details page is a versatile component designed to display a detailed view for content entities like **Topics** and **Sources**. It serves as a hub for a specific entity, showing its description and a feed of all related headlines.

## Core Components

-   **`EntityDetailsBloc`**: The BLoC that powers this feature. It is responsible for fetching the primary entity's data (e.g., the `Topic` object) and then fetching a paginated list of `Headline` items that are associated with that entity. It also syncs with the `AccountBloc` to manage the "follow" status of the entity.

-   **`EntityDetailsPage`**: The main UI widget. It can be initialized in two ways: by passing a full entity object (like a `Topic` or `Source`) or by passing an `entityId` and `contentType`. The page displays the entity's details at the top and a scrollable list of related headlines below.

## Key Functionalities

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Generic and Reusable" icon="puzzle">
		This page is designed to be generic. The same `EntityDetailsPage` is used to display information for both Topics and Sources, reducing code duplication and ensuring a consistent user experience across different content types.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Dynamic Content Loading" icon="list-ordered">
		The page first loads the details of the entity itself. Once the entity is loaded, the `EntityDetailsBloc` begins fetching the associated headlines, with support for infinite scrolling to load more articles as the user scrolls down.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Follow/Unfollow Actions" icon="user-check">
		A prominent "follow" button allows users to follow or unfollow the displayed topic or source. This action is dispatched to the `AccountBloc`. The `EntityDetailsBloc` subscribes to state changes from the `AccountBloc` to reactively update the UI of the follow button.
	</Card>
    <Card title="Integrated Feed" icon="newspaper">
        The list of related headlines is not just a simple list; it's a fully integrated feed. The `FeedInjectorService` is used to dynamically insert ads and other content into the headline list, just like in the main headlines feed.
