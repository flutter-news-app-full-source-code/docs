This guide provides step-by-step instructions to get the Flutter mobile client running on your local machine for development and testing.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Flutter SDK**: The mobile client is a Flutter application. Please follow the official [Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) for your operating system.
- **An IDE**: A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the Flutter extension or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

## Understanding the Environments

The application can be run in three different environments, configured in `lib/main.dart`:

- `AppEnvironment.demo`: This is the default environment. It uses an in-memory data store (`DataInMemory`) populated with mock data. This is perfect for quickly running the app and exploring the UI without needing a live backend. The app also wraps itself in the `DevicePreview` package in this mode, allowing you to see how it looks on various devices.
- `AppEnvironment.development`: This environment is configured to connect to a local instance of the API server. It uses the `DataApi` client to make live HTTP requests.
- `AppEnvironment.production`: This environment points to your live, deployed API server.

You can change the active environment by modifying the `appEnvironment` constant in `lib/main.dart`:

```dart title="lib/main.dart"
// Define the current application environment (production/development/demo).
const appEnvironment = AppEnvironment.demo;
```

## Dependency Injection

The application's dependencies, such as repositories and data clients, are initialized in the `bootstrap.dart` file. This function reads the selected `AppEnvironment` and injects the appropriate data clients.

For example, in `demo` mode, it injects `AuthInmemory` and `DataInMemory` clients. In `development` or `production` mode, it sets up an `HttpClient` and injects `AuthApi` and `DataApi` clients to communicate with the backend. This clean separation makes the app highly testable and configurable.

## Running the Application

<Steps>
1.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**

    Open your terminal and navigate to the mobile client's root directory:
    ```sh
    cd apps/flutter-news-app-mobile-client-full-source-code
    ```

2.  **Get Dependencies**

    Run the following command to fetch all the required packages from `pubspec.yaml`:
    ```sh
    flutter pub get
    ```

3.  **Select a Device**

    Ensure you have a simulator running (iOS) or an emulator running (Android), or a physical device connected. You can see a list of available devices with:
    ```sh
    flutter devices
    ```

4.  **Run the App**

    Start the application using the `flutter run` command. By default, this will launch the app in `demo` mode.
    ```sh
    flutter run
    ```
</Steps>

The application should now be running on your selected device. Because it's in `demo` mode, you can immediately start exploring the UI and features with the pre-loaded mock data.
