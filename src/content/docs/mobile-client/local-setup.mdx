This guide will walk you through setting up and running the Flutter News App Mobile Client on your local machine.

<Steps>
1.  **Prerequisites**

    Before you begin, you must have the Flutter SDK installed on your system. To ensure you are using the most up-to-date and accurate installation instructions, we recommend following the official guide directly from the Flutter team.

    -   **Flutter SDK:** Please follow the [Official Flutter Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) for your specific operating system.

2.  **Clone the Repository**

    Open your terminal and clone the mobile client repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/flutter-news-app-full-source-code/flutter-news-app-mobile-client-full-source-code.git
    cd flutter-news-app-mobile-client-full-source-code
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**

    Fetch all the required Dart and Flutter packages for the project:

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

4.  **Configure the Environment**

    The mobile client can be run in different environments, allowing you to connect it to a live API, a local API, or run it with mock data for UI development.

    -   Open the file `lib/main.dart`.
    -   Locate the `appEnvironment` constant.
    -   Set its value to one of the following:
        -   `AppEnvironment.demo`: **(Recommended for UI development)** Runs the app with in-memory mock data. No backend API is required, making it perfect for focusing on UI changes and component testing.
        -   `AppEnvironment.development`: Connects the app to a locally running instance of the API server (typically at `http://localhost:8080`).
        -   `AppEnvironment.production`: Connects the app to your live, deployed backend API.

    ```dart title="lib/main.dart"
    // Use `AppEnvironment.demo` to run with in-memory data (no API needed).
    // Use `AppEnvironment.development` to connect to a local backend API.
    // Use `AppEnvironment.production` to connect to a live backend API.
    const appEnvironment = AppEnvironment.demo;
    ```

    <Aside>
    For the `development` environment, you must have the [API Server running locally](/docs/api-server/local-setup/) first.
    </Aside>

5.  **Run the Application**

    Start the Flutter development server. Ensure you have a simulator/emulator running or a physical device connected.

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

    The application will now be running on your selected device.

</Steps>
