This guide will walk you through setting up and running the Flutter News App Mobile Client on your local machine.

<Steps>
1.  **Prerequisites**

    Before you begin, you must have the Flutter SDK installed on your system. To ensure you are using the most up-to-date and accurate installation instructions, we recommend following the official guide directly from the Flutter team.

    -   **Flutter SDK:** Please follow the [Official Flutter Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) for your specific operating system.

2.  **Set Up a Firebase Project (Required)**

    The mobile client requires a Firebase project for core features like push notifications. You will need to create your own Firebase project as the configuration files are not included in the source code.

    -   **Create a Firebase Project:** Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.

    -   **Add an Android App:**
        -   In your Firebase project, add an Android app.
        -   The package name must match the one in the project: `com.example.flutter_news_app_mobile_client_full_source_code`.
        -   Download the generated `google-services.json` file.

    -   **Add an iOS App:**
        -   In the same Firebase project, add an iOS app.
        -   The iOS bundle ID must match the one in the project: `com.example.flutterNewsAppMobileClientFullSourceCode`.
        -   Download the generated `GoogleService-Info.plist` file.

    -   **Place the Configuration Files:**
        -   Place the `google-services.json` file in the `android/app/` directory of the mobile client project.
        -   Place the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file in the `ios/Runner/` directory of the mobile client project.

3.  **Set Up OneSignal (Optional)**

    If you plan to use OneSignal for push notifications, create an account and a project on the OneSignal Dashboard. You will need the App IDs for Android and iOS from the **Keys & IDs** section of your OneSignal project settings.

4.  **Download the Latest Release**

    Download the source code of the latest release from the GitHub releases page for the Mobile Client:

    -   **Mobile Client:** [https://github.com/flutter-news-app-full-source-code/flutter-news-app-mobile-client-full-source-code/releases/latest](https://github.com/flutter-news-app-full-source-code/flutter-news-app-mobile-client-full-source-code/releases/latest)

    After downloading and extracting the archive, navigate into the project directory.

5.  **Install Dependencies**

    Fetch all the required Dart and Flutter packages for the project:

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

6.  **Configure the Environment**

    The mobile client uses compile-time variables to configure its environment. This allows you to easily switch between mock data, a local API, or a live production API without changing the code.

    #### Required Environment Variables

    For a `development` or `production` build, you must provide the following variables. The Firebase values can be copied directly from the `google-services.json` and `GoogleService-Info.plist` files you downloaded earlier.

    -   `APP_ENVIRONMENT`: `development` or `production`.
    -   `BASE_URL`: The URL of your API server (e.g., `http://localhost:8080` for local development).

    **OneSignal Keys:**
    -   `ONE_SIGNAL_ANDROID_APP_ID`: Your OneSignal Android App ID.
    -   `ONE_SIGNAL_IOS_APP_ID`: Your OneSignal iOS App ID.

    **Firebase Keys (from `google-services.json` & `GoogleService-Info.plist`):**
    -   `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`: from `project_info.project_id`
    -   `FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`: from `project_info.project_number`
    -   `FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`: from `project_info.storage_bucket`
    -   `FIREBASE_ANDROID_API_KEY`: from `client[0].api_key[0].current_key`
    -   `FIREBASE_ANDROID_APP_ID`: from `client[0].client_info.mobilesdk_app_id`
    -   `FIREBASE_IOS_API_KEY`: from the `API_KEY` field in your `.plist` file.
    -   `FIREBASE_IOS_APP_ID`: from the `GOOGLE_APP_ID` field in your `.plist` file.

    <Aside type="tip">
        For an even easier workflow, you can configure your editor to run these commands for you. Check out the [Configuring VS Code Launch Environments](/docs/vscode-launch-configurations/) guide.

7.  **Run the Application**

    Start the application using one of the commands below. Ensure you have a simulator/emulator running or a physical device connected.

    -   **Demo Mode (Default):**
        Runs the app with in-memory mock data. No backend API or extra variables are required, making it perfect for focusing on UI changes.
        ```bash
        flutter run
        ```

    -   **Development Mode:**
        Connects the app to a locally running instance of the API server. You must provide all the required `--dart-define` variables.

        ```bash
        # Example for Android
        flutter run \
          --dart-define=APP_ENVIRONMENT=development \
          --dart-define=BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 \
          --dart-define=ONE_SIGNAL_ANDROID_APP_ID=YOUR_ONESIGNAL_ID \
          --dart-define=FIREBASE_ANDROID_API_KEY=YOUR_FIREBASE_ANDROID_API_KEY \
          # ... and all other required keys
        ```

    <Aside>
    For the `development` environment, you must have the [API Server running locally](/docs/api-server/local-setup/) first.
    </Aside>

    <Aside type="note">
    To connect to your local API server from a physical mobile device, additional configuration is required. Please see the [Connecting to a Local API from a Physical Device](/docs/development-environment-setup/) guide.
    </Aside>

    The application will now launch on your selected device.
