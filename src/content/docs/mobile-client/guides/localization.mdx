The mobile client is fully internationalized using Flutter's built-in localization support. This guide explains how to add new translation strings and support for new languages.

### Localization Files

All translation strings are stored in Application Resource Bundle (`.arb`) files located in the `lib/l10n/arb/` directory.

-   `app_en.arb`: Contains the English translations. This is the template file.
-   `app_ar.arb`: Contains the Arabic translations.

Each entry in an `.arb` file consists of a key, the translated string, and an optional description.

```json title="lib/l10n/arb/app_en.arb"
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "accountPageTitle": "Account",
    "@accountPageTitle": {
        "description": "Title for the account page"
    }
}
```

### How to Add a New Translation String

<Steps>
1.  **Add the Key to the English Template**

    Open `lib/l10n/arb/app_en.arb` and add a new entry for your string. Provide a clear key and a helpful description.

    ```json
    "myNewFeatureTitle": "My New Feature",
    "@myNewFeatureTitle": {
        "description": "Title for the new feature page"
    }
    ```

2.  **Add Translations to Other Languages**

    Open the `.arb` file for each supported language (e.g., `app_ar.arb`) and add the corresponding translated string for the new key.

    ```json
    "myNewFeatureTitle": "ميزتي الجديدة",
    ```

3.  **Generate Dart Code**

    Flutter's localization tool automatically generates Dart code from your `.arb` files. This process is usually triggered automatically when you save an `.arb` file if you are using a modern IDE with the Flutter extension.

    If you need to run it manually, execute the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    flutter gen-l10n
    ```

4.  **Use the String in Your UI**

    You can now access your new string in any widget that has a `BuildContext` using the generated `AppLocalizations` class.

    ```dart
    import 'package:flutter_news_app_mobile_client_full_source_code/l10n/l10n.dart';

    // ... inside a build method
    Text(context.l10n.myNewFeatureTitle);
    ```

</Steps>

### How to Add a New Language

To add support for a new language, such as French:
1.  Create a new file: `lib/l10n/arb/app_fr.arb`.
2.  Set the locale at the top of the file: `"@@locale": "fr"`.
3.  Copy all the keys from `app_en.arb` and provide the French translations.
4.  Run `flutter gen-l10n` to update the generated code.
5.  Finally, add the new language to the list of supported languages in `lib/app/view/app.dart`.
