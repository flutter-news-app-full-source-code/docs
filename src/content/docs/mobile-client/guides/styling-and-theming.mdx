The mobile client's visual appearance is managed by a centralized theming system located in the `ui_kit` package. This allows for consistent styling and easy customization of the app's look and feel. The system is built on top of the powerful `flex_color_scheme` package.

### Core Theming Files

All theme-related logic is located in `packages/ui-kit/lib/src/theme/app_theme.dart`. This file contains:

-   **`lightTheme()` and `darkTheme()`**: These functions generate the `ThemeData` for the light and dark modes of the application.
-   **`_commonSubThemesData`**: A constant that defines shared customizations for common widgets like `Card`, `AppBar`, and `InputDecorator`.
-   **`_customizeTextTheme()`**: A helper function that applies user-selected font sizes and weights to the base `TextTheme`.
-   **`_getGoogleFontTextTheme()`**: A helper that maps a font family name (e.g., "Roboto") to the corresponding text theme function from the `google_fonts` package.

### How to Customize the Theme

#### 1. Changing Colors

The application uses predefined color schemes from `FlexColorScheme`. You can change the active color scheme by modifying the `AppAccentTheme` enum in `packages/core/lib/src/enums/app_enums.dart` and updating the `_mapAppAccentTheme` helper in `lib/app/bloc/app_bloc.dart`.

To add a completely new custom color scheme:
1.  Define your custom `FlexSchemeData` in `app_theme.dart`.
2.  Add a new value to the `AppAccentTheme` enum.
3.  Update the `_mapAppAccentTheme` helper in `AppBloc` to map your new enum value to your custom scheme.

#### 2. Customizing Widget Styles

You can change the default appearance of common widgets by modifying the `_commonSubThemesData` constant in `app_theme.dart`.

For example, to change the default elevation of all cards in the app:

```dart title="packages/ui-kit/lib/src/theme/app_theme.dart"
const FlexSubThemesData _commonSubThemesData = FlexSubThemesData(
  // ...
  cardElevation: 4.0,
  // ...
);
```

#### 3. Adding a New Font

To make a new font available for users to select:
1.  Add the font to your project assets and declare it in `pubspec.yaml`.
2.  Add the new font name to the list of available fonts in `lib/settings/view/font_settings_page.dart`.
3.  Update the `_getGoogleFontTextTheme` helper in `app_theme.dart` to map the new font name to its `GoogleFonts` text theme function.
