Welcome to the local setup guide for the Flutter News App Toolkit. To get the full ecosystem running on your local machine, you will need to set up each of the three core components: the **API Server**, the **Web Dashboard**, and the **Mobile Client**.

Follow the guides below in the recommended order to ensure a smooth setup process.

<Steps>
1.  **Set Up the API Server**

    Start by getting the backend running. The API server handles data, authentication, and configuration for both the dashboard and the mobile app.

2.  **Set Up the Web Dashboard**

    Next, run the web-based administrative dashboard. You'll use this to manage content and configure the application.

3.  **Set Up the Mobile Client**

    Finally, set up the Flutter mobile app for iOS and Android to see the end-user experience.
