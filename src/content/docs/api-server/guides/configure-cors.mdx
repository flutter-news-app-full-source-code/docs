Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security feature that browsers use to restrict web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the page. For your Flutter Web Dashboard to communicate with the API server in a production environment, you must explicitly tell the server to allow requests from the dashboard's domain.

### How it Works in This Project

The API server has built-in middleware that handles CORS. By default, it is configured to allow requests from `localhost` during development, so you don't need to worry about it on your local machine.

However, for a deployed production environment, you **must** set the `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN` environment variable.

### Configuration

1.  **Identify Your Web Dashboard's URL:**
    Determine the exact URL where your Flutter Web Dashboard will be hosted.
    -   Example: `https://dashboard.yourdomain.com`

2.  **Set the Environment Variable:**
    In your production hosting environment (e.g., Google Cloud Run, Render, DigitalOcean App Platform), set the `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN` environment variable to your dashboard's URL.

    ```env
    CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN="https://dashboard.yourdomain.com"
    ```

<Aside type="caution" title="Be Specific">
Do not use a wildcard (`*`) for the allowed origin in production, as it is insecure. Always specify the exact URL of your web client. The server is configured to only allow a single, specific origin.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter CORS errors in your browser's developer console (e.g., `Access to fetch at '...' from origin '...' has been blocked by CORS policy`), it almost always means the `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN` is either not set or does not exactly match the URL of your running web application.
