The application uses a special environment variable, `OVERRIDE_ADMIN_EMAIL`, to provide a secure and reliable way to manage the primary administrator account. This is the designated method for initial setup or for recovering access if the admin email needs to be changed.

This process is handled at the server level, not through the dashboard UI, to ensure maximum security.

### How It Works

When the API server starts, it checks for the `OVERRIDE_ADMIN_EMAIL` variable. If this variable is set, the server performs an automatic process to ensure the user with that email is the sole administrator.

This provides a powerful mechanism to:
-   **Set the initial administrator** on first deployment.
-   **Change the administrator email** if needed.
-   **Recover access** if the current administrator account is inaccessible.

### How to Change the Admin Account

To set or change the administrator email, you must modify the environment variables in your server's hosting environment.

1.  **Set the Environment Variable:**
    In your production hosting environment (e.g., Google Cloud Run, Render), set the `OVERRIDE_ADMIN_EMAIL` variable to the desired email address.

    ```env
    OVERRIDE_ADMIN_EMAIL="new-admin@example.com"
    ```

2.  **Restart the Server:**
    Restart your API server application. On startup, the server will automatically handle the admin account update.

<Aside type="note">
For a detailed explanation of how this variable works and its different behaviors (creating, replacing, or updating), please refer to the **[Administrator Override section in the Environment Variables guide](/docs/api-server/guides/configure-environment-variables/#administrator-override)**.

<Aside type="caution" title="Security Best Practice">
Once the server has restarted and the admin account has been successfully updated, it is recommended to remove the `OVERRIDE_ADMIN_EMAIL` variable from your environment. This prevents accidental changes on subsequent server restarts.
