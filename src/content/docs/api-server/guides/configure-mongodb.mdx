The API server requires a MongoDB database to store all its data, including headlines, users, and settings. For local development, running a MongoDB instance directly on your machine using Docker is the recommended approach as it provides a clean, isolated, and consistent environment.

### Using Docker (Recommended)

1.  **Install Docker:**
    If you don't have it already, download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for your operating system. This application will manage your Docker images and containers.

2.  **Pull and Run the MongoDB Image:**
    Open your terminal and run the following command. This single command will automatically:
    a.  Download the latest official `mongo` image from Docker Hub if you don't have it locally.
    b.  Create and start a new container from that image.

    ```bash
    docker run --name mongodb-local -p 27017:27017 -d mongo:latest
    ```

    **Command Breakdown:**
    -   `--name mongodb-local`: Assigns a memorable name to your container for easy management.
    -   `-p 27017:27017`: Maps port `27017` inside the container to port `27017` on your local machine, allowing the API server to connect.
    -   `-d`: Runs the container in "detached" mode, meaning it runs in the background.
    -   `mongo:latest`: Specifies the official MongoDB image to use.

3.  **Verify the Container is Running:**
    You can check that your container started successfully by running:
    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```
    You should see `mongodb-local` in the list of running containers.

### Updating Your `.env` File

Once your local MongoDB instance is running, you need to tell the API server how to connect to it.

Open your `.env` file and set the `DATABASE_URL` variable:

```env
DATABASE_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017/flutter_news_app_db"
```

-   `localhost:27017`: This is the default host and port for a local MongoDB instance.
-   `flutter_news_app_db`: You can name your database anything you like. The server will create it automatically on first connection if it doesn't exist.
