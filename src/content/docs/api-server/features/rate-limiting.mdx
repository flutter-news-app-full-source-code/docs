To ensure the stability and security of the API, the server includes a built-in rate-limiting feature. This system automatically tracks the number of requests from a given source and blocks further requests if they exceed a configured limit within a specific time window.

This is crucial for preventing abuse, such as brute-force attacks on the authentication endpoints or overly aggressive polling of the data API.

### How It Works

The rate-limiting mechanism is implemented as a middleware that runs on specific routes. It uses the client's IP address as the primary identifier for tracking requests.

There are two distinct rate-limiting configurations applied to different parts of the API:

1.  **Sensitive Endpoint Limiting:**
    -   **Target:** The `/api/v1/auth/request-code` endpoint.
    -   **Purpose:** This endpoint is more sensitive as it triggers an email to be sent. The rate limit here is intentionally strict to prevent spamming users with verification codes.
    -   **Default Limit:** 3 requests per 24 hours.

2.  **General Data API Limiting:**
    -   **Target:** All endpoints under `/api/v1/data`.
    -   **Purpose:** This provides a generous limit for general application usage while still protecting the server from excessively frequent requests from a single client.
    -   **Default Limit:** 1000 requests per 60 minutes.

Users with the `admin` or `publisher` role automatically bypass all rate limits, ensuring that administrative tasks are never blocked.

### Configuration

These limits are configurable via environment variables, allowing you to adjust them for your specific production needs. For details, see the [Configure Environment Variables](/docs/api-server/guides/configure-environment-variables) guide.

### Error Response

When a client exceeds a rate limit, the API will respond with an HTTP `429 Too Many Requests` status code and the following error payload:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "forbidden",
    "message": "You have made too many requests. Please try again later."
  }
}
