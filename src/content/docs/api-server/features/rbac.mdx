title: 'Feature: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)'
description: An overview of the server's permission system for securing API endpoints and actions.

The API server implements a granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system to ensure that users can only access the data and perform the actions appropriate for their level of authorization.

The system is built around two key concepts: **Roles** and **Permissions**.

### Dual-Role System

Each user in the system has two distinct roles, which combine to define their total permissions:

1.  **`appRole`**: This role governs a user's permissions within the mobile application. The possible values are:
    *   `guestUser`: For anonymous users with limited access.
    *   `standardUser`: For authenticated users with regular access.
    *   `premiumUser`: For subscribed users with access to all app features.

2.  **`dashboardRole`**: This role governs a user's permissions for administrative and content management tasks, primarily through the web dashboard. The possible values are:
    *   `none`: The default for regular app users with no dashboard access.
    *   `publisher`: Can manage content like headlines and sources.
    *   `admin`: Has full control over all system data and settings.

### Permissions

Permissions are specific action strings that follow a `resource.action` format (e.g., `headline.create`, `user.read_owned`). A user's combined roles grant them a set of these permissions.

The `PermissionService` is the core component that checks if a user has a required permission before allowing an action to proceed.

### How It Works in Practice

When a user makes an API request, the following happens:

1.  The **Authentication Middleware** verifies the user's JWT and identifies the user.
2.  The **Authorization Middleware** determines what permission is required for the requested action (e.g., `headline.create` for a `POST` to `?model=headline`).
3.  It then asks the `PermissionService`: "Does this user have the `headline.create` permission?"
4.  The `PermissionService` checks the user's `appRole` and `dashboardRole`, looks up the permissions for those roles in the `role_permissions.dart` map, and returns `true` or `false`.
5.  If the check passes, the request continues. If it fails, the server returns a `403 Forbidden` error.

This system provides a secure and centralized way to manage access control across the entire API.
