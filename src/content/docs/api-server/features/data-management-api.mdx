title: 'Feature: Generic Data API'
description: An explanation of the powerful, model-driven generic data endpoint for managing all application content.

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

A key architectural feature of the API server is its generic data endpoint, located at `/api/v1/data`. Instead of having separate endpoints for each data type (e.g., `/headlines`, `/topics`), this single, powerful endpoint can manage multiple data models through a simple query parameter.

This approach simplifies the API surface, reduces code duplication, and makes the system highly extensible.

### How It Works

A client makes a standard REST request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to the `/api/v1/data` endpoint and specifies the target data type using the `?model=` query parameter.

**Example: Fetching all headlines**
```http
GET /api/v1/data?model=headline
```

**Example: Fetching a single topic by its ID**
```http
GET /api/v1/data/some-topic-id?model=topic
```

### The Dual Registry System

The power behind this generic endpoint comes from two central registries:

1.  **The Model Registry (`ModelRegistry`)**: This registry defines the **rules** for each model. It maps a model name (e.g., `"headline"`) to a configuration object that specifies authorization requirements, ownership details, and how to handle JSON data for that model.

2.  **The Data Operation Registry (`DataOperationRegistry`)**: This registry provides the **actions**. It maps a model name to the actual functions that perform the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

### Supported Models

The generic data endpoint can manage the following models out-of-the-box:
-   `headline`
-   `topic`
-   `source`
-   `country`
-   `language`
-   `user`
-   `user_app_settings`
-   `user_content_preferences`
-   `remote_config`
-   `dashboard_summary`

<Aside type="caution" title="Read-Only Models">
The `country` and `language` models are configured to be **read-only** through the API. This is an intentional design choice. This foundational data is managed centrally via the database seeding process and is not intended to be modified by users.
</Aside>

<Aside type="note">
Some actions are intentionally unsupported through this generic endpoint for security or logical reasons. For example, creating a new user is handled exclusively by the dedicated `/api/v1/auth/verify-code` endpoint, not by a POST request to `?model=user`. These restrictions are defined in the `ModelRegistry` for each model.
