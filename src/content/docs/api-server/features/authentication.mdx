The API server provides a robust and flexible authentication system designed to handle various user scenarios securely. It uses a passwordless email and code flow, supports anonymous guest access, and manages sessions using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

### Key Authentication Flows

#### 1. Passwordless Email + Code Sign-In

Instead of traditional passwords, the system uses a secure one-time code sent to the user's email address.

-   **Requesting a Code (`/api/v1/auth/request-code`):** The client sends the user's email to this endpoint. The server generates a 6-digit code, stores it temporarily, and emails it to the user.
-   **Verifying a Code (`/api/v1/auth/verify-code`):** The client sends the user's email and the 6-digit code. The server validates the code. If correct, it either signs the user in (if they exist) or creates a new account and returns a JWT.

<Aside type="note" title="Dashboard Login">
The `request-code` endpoint has a special mode for dashboard logins. If the request includes `"isDashboardLogin": true`, the server first verifies that the user exists and has the necessary `admin` or `publisher` role before sending a code. This prevents unauthorized users from attempting to access the dashboard.

#### 2. Anonymous Guest Sign-In

-   **Creating a Guest Account (`/api/v1/auth/anonymous`):** When a new user opens the app for the first time, the client can call this endpoint to create a temporary guest account. The server returns a new `User` object with a `guestUser` role and a JWT.
-   **Guest-to-Permanent Conversion:** If a guest user decides to sign up with their email, the `verify-code` flow intelligently handles the conversion. The guest account's data (like saved preferences) is preserved as the account is upgraded to a `standardUser` role with the verified email.

#### 3. Session Management with JWT

All authenticated sessions are managed using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

-   **Token Generation:** Upon successful authentication, the server generates a JWT containing the user's ID, roles, and an expiration time.
-   **Authenticated Requests:** The client must include this token in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for all subsequent requests to protected endpoints.
-   **Middleware:** A dedicated authentication middleware on the server is responsible for validating the token on every incoming request.

#### 4. Secure Sign-Out

-   **Token Invalidation (`/api/v1/auth/sign-out`):** When a user signs out, the client calls this endpoint. The server adds the token's unique identifier (JTI) to a blacklist, immediately invalidating it even before it naturally expires. This prevents the token from being reused.
