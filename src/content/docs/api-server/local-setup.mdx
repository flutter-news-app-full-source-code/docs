This guide will walk you through setting up the API server in a local development environment.

<Steps>
1.  **Prerequisites**

    Ensure you have the following software installed on your system:
    -   **Dart SDK:** Version `3.0.0` or higher.
    -   **MongoDB:** Version `5.0` or higher is recommended.
    -   **Dart Frog CLI:** Install it globally by running:
        ```bash
        dart pub global activate dart_frog_cli
        ```

2.  **Clone the Repository**

    If you haven't already, clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/flutter-news-app-full-source-code/flutter-news-app-api-server-full-source-code.git
    cd flutter-news-app-api-server-full-source-code
    ```

3.  **Set Up Local Database**

    The API server requires a MongoDB database. For local development, the recommended approach is to use Docker.

    For a complete walkthrough, follow the [Configure MongoDB for Local Development](/docs/api-server/guides/configure-mongodb) guide.

4.  **Configure Environment Variables**

    The server uses a `.env` file to manage secrets and configuration. You will need to create this file and populate it with the correct values for your local environment.

    For a detailed walkthrough, follow the [Configure Environment Variables](/docs/api-server/guides/configure-environment-variables) guide.

5.  **Install Dependencies**

    Navigate to the server's root directory and fetch the required Dart packages:

    ```bash
    dart pub get
    ```

6.  **Run the Development Server**

    Start the Dart Frog development server:

    ```bash
    dart_frog dev
    ```

    The API will now be running and available at `http://localhost:8080`.

7.  **Automatic Database Seeding**

    On its first startup, the server automatically connects to your MongoDB database and seeds it with initial data (countries, topics, users, etc.). This process is idempotent, meaning you can safely restart the server multiple times without creating duplicate data.

    For more details on how this works, see the [Understand Database Seeding](/docs/api-server/architecture/data-seeding-and-fixtures) guide.
