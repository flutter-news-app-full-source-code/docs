This guide will walk you through setting up the API server in a local development environment.

<Steps>
1.  **Prerequisites**

    Ensure you have the following software installed on your system:
    -   **Dart SDK:** Version `3.0.0` or higher.
    -   **MongoDB:** Version `5.0` or higher is recommended.
    -   **Dart Frog CLI:** Install it globally by running:
        ```bash
        dart pub global activate dart_frog_cli
        ```

2.  **Download the Latest Release**

    Download the source code of the latest release from the GitHub releases page for the API Server:

    -   **API Server:** [https://github.com/flutter-news-app-full-source-code/flutter-news-app-api-server-full-source-code/releases/latest](https://github.com/flutter-news-app-full-source-code/flutter-news-app-api-server-full-source-code/releases/latest)

    After downloading and extracting the archive, navigate into the project directory.

3.  **Set Up Local Database**

    The API server requires a MongoDB database. For local development, the recommended approach is to use Docker.

    For a complete walkthrough, follow the [Configure MongoDB for Local Development](/docs/api-server/guides/configure-mongodb) guide.
    </Aside>

4.  **Configure Environment Variables**

    The server uses a `.env` file to manage secrets and configuration. You will need to create this file and populate it with the correct values for your local environment.

    <Aside type="tip">
    For a detailed walkthrough, follow the [Configure Environment Variables](/docs/api-server/guides/configure-environment-variables) guide.
    </Aside>

5.  **Install Dependencies**

    Navigate to the server's root directory and fetch the required Dart packages:

    ```bash
    dart pub get
    ```

6.  **Run the Development Server**

    Start the Dart Frog development server:

    ```bash
    dart_frog dev
    ```
    <Aside type="note">
    The API will now be running and available at `http://localhost:8080`.
