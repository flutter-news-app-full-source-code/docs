This section details the endpoints used for user authentication, including sign-in, sign-up, and session management.

## Endpoints

### Request Sign-In Code

Initiates the sign-in or sign-up process by sending a one-time verification code to the user's email.

-   **Method:** `POST`
-   **Path:** `/api/v1/auth/request-code`
-   **Body (JSON):**
    ```json
    {
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "isDashboardLogin": false
    }
    ```
    -   `email` (string, required): The user's email address.
    -   `isDashboardLogin` (boolean, optional): Set to `true` when signing in to the admin dashboard. This enforces stricter validation, ensuring the user exists and has the required permissions before sending a code. Defaults to `false`.

-   **Success Response:**
    -   `202 Accepted`: The request has been accepted, and the email is being sent.

-   **Error Responses:**
    -   `400 Bad Request`: The email format is invalid, or the request body is malformed.
    -   `401 Unauthorized`: (`isDashboardLogin: true` only) The user does not exist.
    -   `403 Forbidden`: (`isDashboardLogin: true` only) The user exists but lacks the required permissions for dashboard access.

### Verify Sign-In Code

Verifies the one-time code to complete the sign-in/sign-up process.

-   **Method:** `POST`
-   **Path:** `/api/v1/auth/verify-code`
-   **Body (JSON):**
    ```json
    {
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "code": "123456"
    }
    ```
    -   `email` (string, required): The user's email address.
    -   `code` (string, required): The 6-digit verification code sent to the user's email.

-   **Success Response:**
    -   `200 OK`: Returns a standard success response with an `AuthSuccessResponse` payload.
        ```json
        {
          "data": {
            "user": { ... }, // The full User object
            "token": "ey..." // The JWT authentication token
          },
          "metadata": { ... }
        }
        ```

-   **Error Responses:**
    -   `400 Bad Request`: The code is invalid, expired, or the request body is malformed.

If an authenticated guest user calls this endpoint, their guest account will be seamlessly converted into a new permanent account or merged with an existing one.

### Sign In Anonymously

Creates a temporary guest account for users who have not yet registered.

-   **Method:** `POST`
-   **Path:** `/api/v1/auth/anonymous`
-   **Body:** None

-   **Success Response:**
    -   `200 OK`: Returns a standard success response with an `AuthSuccessResponse` payload, containing the new guest `User` object and a JWT.

### Get Current User

Retrieves the profile of the currently authenticated user.

-   **Method:** `GET`
-   **Path:** `/api/v1/auth/me`
-   **Authentication:** Required (Bearer Token)

-   **Success Response:**
    -   `200 OK`: Returns a standard success response with the full `User` object as the data payload.

-   **Error Responses:**
    -   `401 Unauthorized`: The provided token is missing, invalid, or expired.

### Sign Out

Performs server-side sign-out actions, primarily invalidating the current authentication token.

-   **Method:** `POST`
-   **Path:** `/api/v1/auth/sign-out`
-   **Authentication:** Required (Bearer Token)
-   **Body:** None

-   **Success Response:**
    -   `204 No Content`: The token has been successfully invalidated.

-   **Error Responses:**
    -   `401 Unauthorized`: The provided token is missing, invalid, or expired.

### Delete Account

Permanently deletes the authenticated user's account and all associated data.

-   **Method:** `DELETE`
-   **Path:** `/api/v1/auth/delete-account`
-   **Authentication:** Required (Bearer Token)

-   **Success Response:**
    -   `204 No Content`: The account has been successfully deleted.

-   **Error Responses:**
    -   `401 Unauthorized`: The provided token is missing, invalid, or expired.
