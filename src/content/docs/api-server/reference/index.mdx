import { Card, CardGrid, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Welcome to the complete API reference for the Flutter News App backend. This section provides detailed information about every endpoint, including request formats, response payloads, and authentication requirements.

## Base URL & Versioning

All API endpoints are prefixed with a base URL and a version number.

-   **Base URL:** `http://localhost:8080` (for local development)
-   **API Version:** `v1`

The full path for an endpoint will look like: `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/...`

## Authentication

Most endpoints require authentication. The API uses **Bearer Token** authentication, where a valid JSON Web Token (JWT) must be included in the `Authorization` header of your requests.

```
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>
```

You can obtain a token through the endpoints detailed in the [Authentication Guide](./authentication/).

## Standard Responses

The API uses a standardized format for both successful and error responses to ensure consistency.

### Success Response

Successful requests (HTTP `200 OK`, `201 Created`) will return a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "data": {
    // The main data payload, which can be an object or an array
  },
  "metadata": {
    "requestId": "a-unique-request-id",
    "timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

### Error Response

Failed requests will return an appropriate HTTP status code (e.g., `400`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `500`) and a JSON body with a consistent error structure:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "errorCode",
    "message": "A descriptive error message."
  }
}
```

For a detailed list of possible error codes and their meanings, please see the [Error Handling Guide](../architecture/error-handling//).
