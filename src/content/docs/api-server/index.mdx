The API Server is the core backend component of the Flutter News App Toolkit. Built with the high-performance [Dart Frog](https://dartfrog.vgv.dev/) framework, it provides all the necessary server-side features, including robust authentication, data management, and dynamic remote configuration.

It is designed to work seamlessly with the [Mobile Client](/docs/mobile-client/) and the [Web Dashboard](/docs/web-dashboard/).
