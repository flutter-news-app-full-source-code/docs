title: Error Handling
description: An overview of the standardized error responses from the API.
---

The API uses a standardized error response format and a consistent set of error codes to make error handling predictable for client applications.

## Error Response Structure

All failed requests will return a JSON body with the following structure:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "errorCode",
    "message": "A descriptive error message explaining what went wrong."
  }
}
```

-   `code` (string): A machine-readable error code.
-   `message` (string): A human-readable description of the error.

## Common Error Codes

The following table lists the most common error codes and their corresponding HTTP status codes.

| HTTP Status | Error Code             | Description                                                                                             |
| :---------- | :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `400`       | `badRequest`           | The request was malformed. This can be due to invalid JSON in the body, or incorrect parameter formats (e.g., an invalid `filter` or `sort` query). |
| `400`       | `invalidInput`         | A specific field in the request body or query parameter was invalid or missing.                         |
| `401`       | `unauthorized`         | Authentication is required, but the request lacks a valid Bearer token. This can also mean the token is expired or has been invalidated (e.g., after sign-out). |
| `401`       | `authenticationFailed` | The provided credentials (e.g., verification code) are incorrect.                                       |
| `403`       | `forbidden`            | The authenticated user does not have the necessary permissions to perform the requested action.           |
| `404`       | `notFound`             | The requested resource (e.g., an item with a specific ID) could not be found.                           |
| `409`       | `conflict`             | The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource.            |
| `429`       | `tooManyRequests`            | The request was rejected because the client has exceeded the rate limit.                                |
| `500`       | `serverError`          | A generic error occurred on the server.                                                                 |
| `500`       | `operationFailed`      | A specific, known operation failed on the server for an unexpected reason.                              |
| `500`       | `unknownError`         | An unexpected and unhandled error occurred on the server.                                               |
| `503`       | `networkError`         | The server is temporarily unable to handle the request due to a downstream network issue.               |
