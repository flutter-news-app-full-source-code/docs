title: Generic Data Endpoint
description: Understand the powerful generic data endpoint and model registry pattern used in the API server.

A significant architectural pattern in the API server is the use of a generic data endpoint powered by a `model_registry`. This design provides a single, consistent, and powerful interface for all standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, reducing code duplication and simplifying both the backend and client-side implementations.

### The Challenge: Avoiding Boilerplate

A typical REST API might have separate endpoints for each data type:
-   `/api/v1/headlines`
-   `/api/v1/topics`
-   `/api/v1/sources`
-   ...and so on.

While clear, this approach leads to a lot of boilerplate code, as the logic for handling GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests is often very similar for each model.

### The Solution: A Single Endpoint with a Model Registry

This API server solves the problem by using a single, dynamic endpoint:

```
/api/v1/data
```

This endpoint handles requests for **all** standard data models. The specific model to be acted upon is determined by a `?model=` query parameter.

-   `GET /api/v1/data?model=headline` -> Returns a list of headlines.
-   `GET /api/v1/data/some-id?model=topic` -> Returns a single topic.
-   `POST /api/v1/data?model=source` -> Creates a new source.

### The `model_registry`

The magic behind this is the `model_registry`, a map defined in `lib/src/registry/model_registry.dart`. This registry links the string name of a model (e.g., "headline") to a `ModelConfig` object.

Each `ModelConfig` contains:
-   **Type-Specific Functions:** Functions like `fromJson` to deserialize the data correctly.
-   **Authorization Rules:** A detailed permission configuration for each HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), specifying what roles or permissions are required for that action.

When a request comes in, the server's middleware looks up the `model` parameter in the registry, retrieves the correct configuration, and uses it to:
1.  Authorize the request based on the user's role and the action's permission requirements.
2.  Forward the request to the correct generic `DataRepository`.
3.  Deserialize and serialize data using the correct model class.

<Aside type="note" title="Architectural Benefits">
-   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Eliminates redundant route handlers for CRUD operations.
-   **Consistency:** Provides a uniform API for all data models.
-   **Extensibility:** Adding CRUD support for a new data model is as simple as adding a new entry to the `model_registry`.
-   **Centralized Authorization:** Security rules for data access are defined in one central, easy-to-audit location.
