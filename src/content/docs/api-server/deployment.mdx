description: A guide to building and deploying the Dart Frog API server to a production environment.

import { Steps, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This guide outlines the process for deploying the API server to a production environment. The server is built with Dart Frog and packaged as a Docker container, making it portable and easy to deploy to any hosting provider that supports Docker.

<Aside>
    To ensure you have the most reliable and up-to-date instructions, this guide focuses on the project-specific configuration you need to complete. For the deployment itself, we will refer you to the excellent official documentation from the Dart Frog team, which is the definitive resource.

### Pre-Deployment Configuration

Before you can deploy, you must complete two essential configuration steps.

<Steps>
1.  **Configure Production Environment Variables**

    In your production environment, you will not use a `.env` file. Instead, you must configure the environment variables directly in your chosen hosting provider's interface. This is a critical step for security and proper configuration.

    For a detailed explanation of each required variable, please see the [**Configure Environment Variables Guide**](/docs/api-server/guides/configure-environment-variables).

2.  **Configure CORS**

    For the Web Dashboard to communicate with your API in production, you must correctly configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) by setting the `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN` environment variable.

    For instructions, see the [**Configure CORS Guide**](/docs/api-server/guides/configure-cors).
</Steps>

### Deployment with Dart Frog

Once your configuration is ready, you can proceed with the deployment. The Dart Frog documentation provides comprehensive guides for various hosting providers and deployment strategies (e.g., using Docker, deploying to Google Cloud Run, etc.).

Following the official documentation is the recommended and most reliable path to a successful deployment.
