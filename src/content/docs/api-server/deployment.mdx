This guide outlines the strategy for deploying the API server to a production environment. The recommended method is to use Docker, which creates a portable and consistent container for your application.

<Aside>
The world of cloud hosting and deployment tools evolves rapidly. Instead of providing specific commands that could become outdated, this guide focuses on the essential steps and links to the official documentation for the relevant services. This ensures you always have access to the most current and accurate instructions.

<Steps>
1.  **Configure Production Environment Variables**

    Your first step is to prepare the production configuration for the server. Unlike local development which uses a `.env` file, in production you will use your hosting provider's interface to set environment variables securely.

    For a detailed explanation of each required variable, please see the [Configure Environment Variables](/docs/api-server/how-to/configure-environment-variables) guide.

2.  **Choose a Deployment Strategy**

    The API server repository includes a `Dockerfile`, which allows for two main deployment strategies:

    -   **Deploying a Pre-built Image:** You build the Docker image on your local machine or in a CI/CD pipeline, push it to a container registry (like Docker Hub, Google Container Registry, or Amazon ECR), and then your hosting provider pulls the image from the registry.
    -   **Deploying from Source:** You connect your Git repository directly to the hosting provider, and it uses the `Dockerfile` to build and deploy the image for you.

3.  **Deploy to a Hosting Provider**

    Choose a hosting provider that supports Docker container deployments. Popular and well-documented options include:
    -   [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/deploying)
    -   [Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/)
    -   [DigitalOcean App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/app-platform/)
    -   [Render](https://render.com/docs/docker)

    Follow the official documentation from your chosen provider to deploy your container. During the setup process, you will be prompted to configure the environment variables from Step 1.

4.  **Configure CORS**

    For your web-based dashboard to communicate with the API in production, you must correctly configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).

    For instructions, see the [Configure CORS](/docs/api-server/how-to/configure-cors) guide.
