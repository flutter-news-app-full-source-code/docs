As the primary administrator, you may need to change the email address associated with your admin account. For security reasons, this is not an operation that can be performed from within the dashboard itself. Instead, it is handled by a secure, server-level configuration change.

This process ensures that only an individual with access to the server's deployment environment can make this critical change.

### How to Change the Administrator Email

To set or change the administrator email, you must modify the environment variables in your API server's hosting environment.

1.  **Set the `OVERRIDE_ADMIN_EMAIL` Variable**
    
    In your hosting provider's configuration panel (or in your local `.env` file), set the `OVERRIDE_ADMIN_EMAIL` variable to the email address you want to use for the administrator account.
    
    ```env
    OVERRIDE_ADMIN_EMAIL="new-admin@example.com"
    ```

2.  **Restart the API Server**

    After setting the variable, restart your API server. The system will automatically update the administrator account on startup.

<Aside type="note">
This process uses environment variables. For a detailed explanation of what these variables are and how `OVERRIDE_ADMIN_EMAIL` works, please see the [API Server: Configure Environment Variables](/docs/api-server/guides/configure-environment-variables/) guide.
