The web dashboard provides a powerful set of tools to remotely control the behavior and settings of your live mobile application. This allows you to make dynamic changes without needing to release a new version to the app stores.

Changes made in this section can have an immediate and significant impact on all users of your mobile app. Please review your changes carefully before saving.

### Navigating to App Configuration

1.  After signing in, you will see a navigation menu on the left side of the screen.
2.  Click on the **"App Configuration"** item in the menu.

This will take you to the main configuration screen, which is organized into three tabs: **Feed**, **Advertisements**, and **General**.

### How to Modify Configuration Settings

The process for changing any setting is the same:

1.  **Navigate to the Correct Tab:** Select the tab that contains the settings you wish to modify.
2.  **Change the Values:** Interact with the form fields (text inputs, dropdowns, switches) to set your desired new values.
3.  **Save Your Changes:** After making all your desired changes, click the **"Save Changes"** button in the bottom navigation bar. A confirmation dialog will appear. Click **"Confirm Save"** to apply your changes to the live application.

If you make a mistake, you can click the **"Discard Changes"** button to revert all fields to their last saved state.

### Available Settings

#### Feed Tab

-   **User Content Limits:** Control how many items (topics, sources) a user can follow and how many headlines they can save. You can set these limits independently for Guest, Standard, and Premium users.
-   **Feed Actions:** Adjust how frequently in-feed prompts (like "Rate the App") are shown to Guest and Standard users.

#### Advertisements Tab

-   **Ad Settings:** Fine-tune your monetization strategy by controlling ad frequency, placement, and when full-screen interstitial ads are shown. These can also be set independently for Guest, Standard, and Premium users.

#### General Tab

-   **Maintenance Mode:** Enable this switch to put the mobile app into maintenance mode. Users will see a maintenance screen and will not be able to access the app's content.
-   **Force App Update:** Specify the minimum required version of your app. If a user is on an older version, you can force them to update from the app store. You can also set the iOS and Android app store URLs here.
