This manual provides a step-by-step guide for administrators and publishers on how to manage the content of the news application using the web dashboard.

### Navigating to Content Management

1.  After signing in, you will see a navigation menu on the left side of the screen.
2.  Click on the **"Content Management"** item in the menu.

This will take you to the main content management screen, which is organized into three tabs: **Headlines**, **Topics**, and **Sources**.

### How to Create New Content (Headlines, Topics, Sources)

The process for creating a new headline, topic, or source is very similar.

<Steps>
1.  **Select the Correct Tab**

    Click on the tab corresponding to the type of content you want to create (e.g., click the "Topics" tab to create a new topic).

2.  **Click the "Add" Button**

    In the top right corner of the app bar, click the **"+"** icon. This will take you to the "Create" page for that content type.

3.  **Fill Out the Form**

    Complete all the required fields in the form. Each field will have a descriptive label (e.g., "Topic Name," "Description").

4.  **Save Your Changes**

    Once you have filled out the form, click the **Save** icon in the top right corner of the app bar.

</Steps>

Your new content item will be created and will now appear in the data table.

### How to Edit Existing Content

<Steps>
1.  **Find the Content Item**

    Navigate to the correct tab ("Headlines," "Topics," or "Sources") and find the item you wish to edit in the data table. You can use the pagination controls at the bottom of the table if you have many items.

2.  **Open the Edit Page**

    Click anywhere on the row of the item you want to edit. This will take you to the "Edit" page for that specific item, with all its current data pre-filled in the form.

3.  **Make Your Changes**

    Update the fields in the form as needed.

4.  **Save Your Changes**

    Click the **Save** icon in the top right corner of the app bar to apply your changes.

</Steps>

### How to Archive Content

Archiving content is a "soft delete". It removes an item from the main lists but keeps it in the system for data integrity. This is the standard way to remove content.

<Steps>
1.  **Find the Content Item**

    Navigate to the correct tab ("Headlines," "Topics," or "Sources") and find the item you wish to archive in the data table.

2.  **Click the Archive Icon**

    On the far right of the item's row, you will see a set of action icons. Click the **archive** icon.

</Steps>

The item will be immediately moved to the archive.

### Managing Archived Content

The archive pages allow you to review, restore, or permanently delete content.

<Steps>
1.  **Access the Archive**

    First, select the tab for the content type you're interested in (e.g., "Headlines"). Then, click the **"Archived Items"** icon (looks like a box) in the top right corner of the app bar. This will take you to the archive page for that content type.

2.  **Restore an Item**

    To restore an item, find it in the archived list and click the **restore** icon. The item will be moved back to the main content list with an "active" status.

3.  **Permanently Delete a Headline**

    *Only headlines can be permanently deleted, and only from the archive page.* This is a final, irreversible action.

    To delete a headline forever, find it in the archived headlines list and click the **delete forever** icon (a trash can).

    For safety, a snackbar will appear for 5 seconds with an **"Undo"** button, giving you a chance to reverse the deletion before it becomes permanent.
</Steps>
