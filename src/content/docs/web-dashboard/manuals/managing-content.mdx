This manual provides a step-by-step guide for administrators and publishers on how to manage the content of the news application using the web dashboard.

### Navigating to Content Management

1.  After signing in, you will see a navigation menu on the left side of the screen.
2.  Click on the **"Content Management"** item in the menu.

This will take you to the main content management screen, which is organized into three tabs: **Headlines**, **Topics**, and **Sources**.

### How to Create New Content (Headlines, Topics, Sources)

The process for creating a new headline, topic, or source is very similar.

<Steps>
1.  **Select the Correct Tab**

    Click on the tab corresponding to the type of content you want to create (e.g., click the "Topics" tab to create a new topic).

2.  **Click the "Add" Button**

    In the top right corner of the app bar, click the **"+"** icon. This will take you to the "Create" page for that content type.

3.  **Fill Out the Form**

    Complete all the required fields in the form. Each field will have a descriptive label (e.g., "Topic Name," "Description").

4.  **Save Your Changes**

    Once you have filled out the form, click the **Save** icon in the top right corner of the app bar.

</Steps>

Your new content item will be created and will now appear in the data table.

### How to Edit Existing Content

<Steps>
1.  **Find the Content Item**

    Navigate to the correct tab ("Headlines," "Topics," or "Sources") and find the item you wish to edit in the data table. You can use the pagination controls at the bottom of the table if you have many items.

2.  **Open the Edit Page**

    Click anywhere on the row of the item you want to edit. This will take you to the "Edit" page for that specific item, with all its current data pre-filled in the form.

3.  **Make Your Changes**

    Update the fields in the form as needed.

4.  **Save Your Changes**

    Click the **Save** icon in the top right corner of the app bar to apply your changes.

</Steps>

### How to Delete Content

<Steps>
1.  **Find the Content Item**

    Navigate to the correct tab and find the item you wish to delete in the data table.

2.  **Click the Delete Icon**

    On the far right of the item's row, you will see a set of action icons. Click the **trash can** icon to delete the item.

3.  **Confirm Deletion**

    A confirmation dialog will appear to prevent accidental deletion. Click "Confirm" to permanently delete the item.
