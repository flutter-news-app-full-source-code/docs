This guide covers the essential steps for deploying the Flutter News App Web Dashboard to a production hosting service.

<Aside>
The world of web hosting evolves quickly. To ensure you have the most reliable and up-to-date instructions, this guide focuses on the core deployment process and links to the official documentation for several popular hosting providers. This approach empowers you to use the best practices recommended directly by the services themselves.

<Steps>
1.  **Configure for Production**

    Before building, you must configure the dashboard to connect to your live production API.

    -   Open the file `lib/main.dart`.
    -   Locate the `appEnvironment` constant.
    -   Set its value to `AppEnvironment.production`.

    ```dart title="lib/main.dart"
    // Use `AppEnvironment.production` to connect to a live backend API.
    const appEnvironment = AppEnvironment.production; 
    ```

    <Aside>
    Ensure that the `baseUrl` for the `production` environment in `lib/app/config/app_config.dart` points to the correct URL of your deployed [API Server](/docs/api-server/deployment/).

2.  **Build the Web Application**

    Next, create a production-optimized build of the Flutter web app. This compiles your Dart code to JavaScript and bundles all necessary assets into a single directory for web deployment.

    Run the following command from the root of your web dashboard project:
    ```bash
    flutter build web
    ```
    This command will generate a `build/web` directory containing all the static files required to run your web application.

3.  **Deploy to a Hosting Provider**

    The contents of the `build/web` directory can be deployed to any hosting service that supports static websites. We recommend choosing a provider with a strong global CDN to ensure fast load times for your users.

    Follow the official deployment guide for your chosen provider, using `build/web` as your publish directory:

    -   **GitHub Pages:** [Official Deployment Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)

    Once the deployment is complete, your web dashboard will be live at the URL provided by your hosting service.
