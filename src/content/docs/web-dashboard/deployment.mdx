<Steps>
1.  **Configure for Production**

    Before building, you must configure the dashboard to connect to your live production API.

    -   Open the file `lib/main.dart`.
    -   Locate the `appEnvironment` constant.
    -   Set its value to `AppEnvironment.production`.

    ```dart title="lib/main.dart"
    // Use `AppEnvironment.production` to connect to a live backend API.
    const appEnvironment = AppEnvironment.production; 
    ```

    <Aside>
    Ensure that the `baseUrl` for the `production` environment in `lib/app/config/app_config.dart` points to the correct URL of your deployed [API Server](/docs/api-server/deployment/).

2.  **Follow the Official Flutter Deployment Guide**
