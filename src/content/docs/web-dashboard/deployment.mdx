This guide outlines the process for deploying the Flutter News App Web Dashboard to a production environment.

<Aside>
To ensure you have the most reliable and up-to-date instructions, this guide focuses on the project-specific configuration you need to complete. For the deployment itself, we will refer you to the official Flutter documentation, which is the definitive resource for this task.

### Pre-Deployment Configuration

Before you can build the dashboard for production, you must configure it to connect to your live API server.

<Steps>
1.  **Set the Production Environment**

    -   Open the file `lib/main.dart`.
    -   Locate the `appEnvironment` constant.
    -   Set its value to `AppEnvironment.production`.

    ```dart title="lib/main.dart"
    // Use `AppEnvironment.production` to connect to a live backend API.
    const appEnvironment = AppEnvironment.production; 
    ```

2.  **Verify the API Base URL**

    -   Open the file `lib/app/config/app_config.dart`.
    -   Ensure that the `baseUrl` for the `production` case points to the correct URL of your deployed [API Server](/docs/api-server/deployment/).

</Steps>

### Building and Deploying

Once your configuration is ready, you can proceed with building and deploying the application. The official Flutter documentation provides a comprehensive guide that covers compiling your Dart code to JavaScript and deploying the output to various hosting services.

Following the official guide is the recommended and most reliable path to a successful deployment.
