This guide covers the essential steps for deploying the Flutter News App Web Dashboard to a production hosting service.

<Steps>
1.  **Configure for Production**

    Before building, you must configure the dashboard to connect to your live production API.

    -   Open the file `lib/main.dart`.
    -   Locate the `appEnvironment` constant.
    -   Set its value to `AppEnvironment.production`.

    ```dart title="lib/main.dart"
    // Use `AppEnvironment.production` to connect to a live backend API.
    const appEnvironment = AppEnvironment.production; 
    ```

    <Aside>
    Ensure that the `baseUrl` for the `production` environment in `lib/app/config/app_config.dart` points to the correct URL of your deployed [API Server](/docs/deployment/api-server/).

2.  **Build the Web Application**

    Next, create a production-optimized build of the Flutter web app. This compiles the Dart code to JavaScript and bundles all necessary assets for web deployment.

    Run the following command from the root of your web dashboard project:
    ```bash
    flutter build web
    ```
    This will generate a `build/web` directory containing all the static files for your web application.

3.  **Choose a Hosting Provider**

    You can deploy the contents of the `build/web` directory to any hosting service that supports static websites. Popular and easy-to-use choices include:

    -   [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting)
    -   [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
    -   [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/for/web-applications/)
    -   [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)

4.  **Deploy the Application**

    Follow the deployment instructions for your chosen hosting provider. The general process involves:

    -   Initializing the hosting service in your project directory.
    -   Specifying the `build/web` directory as the public or publish directory.
    -   Running the provider's deploy command from your terminal.

    For example, if you were using Firebase Hosting, the commands would look something like this:

    ```bash
    # Install Firebase CLI (if you haven't already)
    npm install -g firebase-tools

    # Log in to Firebase
    firebase login

    # Initialize Firebase in your project
    firebase init hosting

    # When prompted, set the public directory to "build/web"

    # Deploy to Firebase Hosting
    firebase deploy
    ```

    Once the deployment is complete, your web dashboard will be live at the URL provided by your hosting service.
