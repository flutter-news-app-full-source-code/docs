This guide will walk you through setting up and running the Flutter News App Web Dashboard on your local machine.

<Steps>
1.  **Prerequisites**

    Before you begin, you must have the Flutter SDK installed on your system. To ensure you are using the most up-to-date and accurate installation instructions, we recommend following the official guide directly from the Flutter team.

    -   **Flutter SDK:** Please follow the [Official Flutter Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) for your specific operating system.

2.  **Download the Latest Release**

    Download the source code of the latest release from the GitHub releases page for the Web Dashboard:

    -   **Web Dashboard:** [https://github.com/flutter-news-app-full-source-code/flutter-news-app-web-dashboard-full-source-code/releases/latest](https://github.com/flutter-news-app-full-source-code/flutter-news-app-web-dashboard-full-source-code/releases/latest)

    After downloading and extracting the archive, navigate into the project directory.

3.  **Install Dependencies**

    Fetch all the required Dart and Flutter packages for the project:

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

4.  **Configure the Environment**

    The web dashboard uses compile-time variables to configure its environment. This allows you to easily switch between mock data, a local API, or a live production API without changing the code.

    You can specify the environment by passing a `--dart-define` flag to the `flutter run` command.

    -   **Demo (Default):** Runs the dashboard with in-memory mock data. No backend API is required, making it perfect for focusing on UI changes and component testing.
        ```bash
        flutter run -d chrome
        ```
    -   **Development:** Connects the dashboard to a locally running instance of the API server.
        ```bash
        flutter run -d chrome --dart-define=APP_ENVIRONMENT=development
        ```
    -   **Production:** Connects the dashboard to your live, deployed backend API. You must also provide the base URL for your API.
        ```bash
        flutter run -d chrome --dart-define=APP_ENVIRONMENT=production --dart-define=BASE_URL=https://your.api.com
        ```

    <Aside>
    For the `development` environment, you must have the [API Server running locally](/docs/api-server/local-setup/) first.
    </Aside>

    <Aside type="note">
    To connect to your local API server from a physical mobile device, additional configuration is required. Please see the [Connecting to a Local API from a Physical Device](/docs/development-environment-setup/) guide.
    </Aside>

5.  **Run the Development Server**

    Start the application using one of the commands from the previous step, targeting the Chrome browser.

    For example, to run in `demo` mode:

    ```bash
    flutter run -d chrome
    ```

    The web dashboard will now be running and accessible in your Chrome browser. The `<Aside>` about connecting from a physical device has been removed as it is not relevant for a web-only dashboard.
