The web dashboard is built with localization in mind, making it straightforward to add support for new languages. The process involves creating a new `.arb` file and updating a few places in the code.

<Steps>
1.  **Create a New `.arb` File**

    Application strings are stored in Application Resource Bundle (`.arb`) files located in `lib/l10n/arb/`.

    -   Duplicate the `app_en.arb` file.
    -   Rename the new file to `app_<language_code>.arb`, where `<language_code>` is the two-letter ISO 639-1 code for the new language (e.g., `app_es.arb` for Spanish).
    -   Translate all the string values in the new file.

2.  **Update `l10n.yaml`**

    The `l10n.yaml` file in the root of the project configures the code generation for localization.

    -   Open `l10n.yaml`.
    -   Add your new `.arb` file to the list.

    ```yaml title="l10n.yaml"
    arb-dir: lib/l10n/arb
    template-arb-file: app_en.arb
    output-localization-file: app_localizations.dart
    ```

3.  **Run Code Generation**

    Flutter's localization tool will automatically generate the necessary Dart code to support the new language.

    Run the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    flutter gen-l10n
    ```

4.  **Update the Settings Page**

    To make the new language selectable by the user, you need to add it to the settings page UI.

    -   Open `lib/settings/view/settings_page.dart`.
    -   Locate the `_LanguageSelectionList` widget.
    -   Add the new language code to the `_supportedLanguages` list.
    -   Add a case to the `_getLanguageName` method to provide a display name for the new language.

    ```dart title="lib/settings/view/settings_page.dart"
    class _LanguageSelectionList extends StatelessWidget {
      // ...

      String _getLanguageName(AppLanguage language, AppLocalizations l10n) {
        switch (language) {
          case 'en':
            return l10n.englishLanguage;
          case 'ar':
            return l10n.arabicLanguage;
          // Add your new language here
          case 'es':
            return 'Espa√±ol'; // This should come from your .arb file
        }
      }

      // Add your new language code here
      static const List<AppLanguage> _supportedLanguages = ['en', 'ar', 'es'];
    }
    ```

</Steps>

After completing these steps, the new language will be fully integrated into the web dashboard.
