The Content Management section is where you can perform detailed CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on all your core content types. The section is organized into three tabs:

-   **Headlines:** Manage your individual news content.
-   **Topics:** Manage the categories for your news content.
-   **Sources:** Manage the news sources from which you gather content.

### The Interface

Each tab presents a data table displaying the existing content. From these tables, you can:

-   **View Content:** See a paginated list of all items.
-   **Edit Content:** Click on any item in the table to navigate to its dedicated edit page.
-   **Delete Content:** Use the delete icon on any item to remove it from the database.
-   **Create New Content:** Use the "+" button in the top app bar to navigate to the creation page for the currently active tab (e.g., "Create Headline").

This consistent interface provides a predictable and efficient workflow for managing all aspects of your application's content.
