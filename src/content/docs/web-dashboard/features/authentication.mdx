The web dashboard is protected by a secure, modern authentication system designed for administrators and content publishers.

### Passwordless Sign-In

To enhance security and improve user experience, the dashboard uses a **passwordless, email-based sign-in flow**. This eliminates the need for users to remember a password.

The process is simple:

1.  **Enter Email:** The user enters their registered email address.
2.  **Receive Code:** The system sends a unique, single-use 6-digit verification code to that email address.
3.  **Verify Code:** The user enters the code into the dashboard to complete the sign-in process.

This method ensures that only users with access to the registered email account can gain access to the dashboard.

### Role-Based Access

The system is designed to work with the API server's role-based access control (RBAC). Only users who have been assigned an `admin` or `publisher` role in the `dashboardRole` field of their user profile will be able to successfully sign in.
