Welcome to the local setup guide. Following these steps will get the complete toolkit—the API Server, Web Dashboard, and Mobile Client—running on your local machine for evaluation and development.

We recommend following the guides in the order presented to ensure a smooth setup process.

<Steps>
1.  **Set Up the API Server**

    Start by getting the backend running. The API server is the core of the toolkit, handling data and authentication for both clients.

    [Go to API Setup Guide &rarr;](/docs/api-server/local-setup/)

2.  **Set Up the Web Dashboard**

    Next, run the web-based administrative dashboard. You'll use this to manage content and see the system in action.

3.  **Set Up the Mobile Client**

    Finally, set up the Flutter mobile app for iOS and Android to explore the end-user experience.

### Next Steps: Customize Your Toolkit

Congratulations! You now have the entire toolkit running locally. This is the perfect time to explore the architecture and learn how to make it your own.

The next logical step is to dive into our **Architecture & Customization** section, where you will learn how to take ownership of the shared packages and begin customizing your applications.
